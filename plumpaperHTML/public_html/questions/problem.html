                A: We would never leave you with an incorrect or damaged product. Each item is handmade right here in our San Diego office by our wonderful staff. While we strive to make each product perfect, if the error or damage was made on our part, please contact us right away. Just give us your order number and what is wrong with your order. We will be sure to fix the problem right away.
                <br><br>
                Unfortunately, if the error was NOT made on our part (misspelled name, wrong monogram, wrong color), we are not able to send a replacement or refund.

                A: Please double check your SHIPPING ADDRESS when checking out. Plum Paper is not responsible for additional shipping charges for packages that are returned to us due to incorrect shipping names or addresses. Plum Paper is not responsible if a forwarding address is not honored, but is returned to us instead.
