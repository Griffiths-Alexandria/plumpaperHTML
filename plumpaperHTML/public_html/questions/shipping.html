                A: If you select Standard Shipping as your shipping option, your package will be shipped via UPS Mail Innovations. This means that your package is transported to your home town via UPS. Once it arrives in your home town, it will be transferred to your local post office for the final delivery to you. The transit time for this method is 3-8 BUSINESS days. If you select Priority Shipping as your shipping option, your package will be shipped via USPS Priority Mail. The transit time for this method is 2-3 BUSINESS days.            </div>

A: The recipient of an international shipment may be subject to customs brokerage fees, import duties, and taxes after the shipment reaches the destination country. Additional charges are the responsibility of the recipient because we have no control over these government-imposed charges and cannot determine what they may be. Customs policies vary greatly among countries. Please contact your local customs office for information.
<br><br>
To avoid a delay in receiving your order from customs, consider the following: 
<br><br>
- Please do not refuse a shipment or ignore requests from carriers regarding duty and/or tax liability charges. Be aware that most carriers will hold a shipment for 5 days after arrival in your country before they return it to the sender.
<br>
- We do not refund original shipping charges for goods that are refused for delivery at customs.
